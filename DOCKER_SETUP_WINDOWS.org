* Install Docker Toolbox

  Docker Toolbox is for older Windows systems. Docker Desktop for Windows is a
  newer application, however it uses Hyper-V, which does not allow container
  device access.

** Check Virtualization Enabled

   1. Launch a command prompt or Windows PowerShell window.
   2. Enter the command given below:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        systeminfo.exe
      #+END_SRC

   3. Wait few seconds (It takes a few seconds to gather information about your
      system but then gives you a result)
   4. Look under Hyper-V Requirements.
   5. See that Virtualization Enabled In Firmware reads Yes or that 'A
      hypervisor has been detected'.
   6. If Virtualization has not been enabled, restart the computer and enable
      virtualization in BIOS or UEFI.

** Disable Hyper-V

   1. Open an elevated PowerShell Command Prompt window.
   2. At the command prompt, run the following command:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
      #+END_SRC
